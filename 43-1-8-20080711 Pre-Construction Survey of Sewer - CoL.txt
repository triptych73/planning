# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Location

Lambeth Hill by St Mary Somerset Tower.

## 1.2 Purpose of Survey

To verify the condition of the sewer prior to adjacent construction works.

## 1.3 Method of Survey

The survey was undertaken by a man-entry sewer survey gang who measured the location of current defects and noted their type and, if necessary, the severity and recorded them photographically. Connections within the sewer in the vicinity of the proposed construction works were also noted and recorded photographically.

The works within confined space were carried out in accordance with the Policy, Procedures and ‘Safe Systems of Work in Sewers’ manual, produced by the London Boroughs Drainage Group, the Association of Thames Drainage Authorities and Water Training International.

## 1.4 General Observations

The sewer in the vicinity of the proposed construction works was in good condition, with no defects noted.

Upstream of the area surveyed, bricks and rubble were noticed in the invert of the sewer. This deposit does not seem to have had an affect on the function of the sewer, however, Thames Water Utilities Ltd have been informed of what was found.
