# 4.0 Scheme Assessment and Justification

## General Description of Proposals and Scheme Benefits

The proposals are for the conversion of the former bell tower into a single dwelling, as set out in the application description of development. As part of the necessary building works, the tower will be repaired and cleaned in places. Openings will be given a more considered and appropriate treatment, and the applicant has agreed to the lighting of the tall, unusually shaped finials that crown the tower.

Giving such a structure a new purpose—be it residential or office—necessarily entails a range of changes, insertions for services, systems to combat fire, access improvements, and so on.

It is considered that the scale and configuration of the tower, as well as its location, effectively rules out any other use. Residential is highly desirable, in heritage terms, because it avoids the need for lift access and intensive servicing requirements. Single residential use maintains the architectural form as an entity, and the particular use by bringing into use every available part of the tower makes it more likely that the character as a whole will be maintained and kept sound and secure.

The consequent requirements for this new use are:

- Changes to the treatment of existing openings
- Need for alternative means of escape
- Need for efficient and relatively easy vertical circulation by means of new stairs and a lift (given the considerable height of the tower)
- The insertion of new floors and creation of new spaces
- The insertion of building services
- A new interface with the public realm (bin stores, for example)
- Measures to protect the amenity of the residents, taking into account the largely commercial character of the surroundings and the noise of traffic along Lower Thames Street

There is a particular UDP policy issue with the provision of residential accommodation in this location, noted in policy HOUS1. This states that whilst new residential accommodation is desirable, its location should not prejudice the City's commercial role.

Whilst the tower is located in a predominantly commercial area, it is not immediately proximate to these uses. It is further insulated from surrounding businesses by the small garden that serves the structure's immediate setting, an attractively laid out space. This garden currently provides a buffer for the future occupants of the tower.

We consider, notwithstanding the above points, that any potential conflict with HOUS1 would be set against the Unitary Development Plan's policies on preserving listed buildings and PPG15 emphasis on the need to find the best optimum viable use for a heritage asset that is consistent with its preservation. In sum, we consider that more weight needs to be accorded to heritage planning policies to find such a use, in consideration of the considerable architectural and historic interest of the tower, reflected in its grade, resulting not least from its association with Sir Christopher Wren.

## Note on Archaeology

This is discussed in section 3.0 above and in the cover note accompanying the application. The City Archaeologist is content for the archaeological potential of the site to be handled by means of a standard condition on the grant of planning permission, requiring an archaeological method statement to be implemented during the construction procurement phase of the project.

## Methodology for Bringing Forward the Current Proposals

The proposals have been developed on the basis of a thorough understanding of the fabric and condition (both architectural and historic) of the tower, with the assistance of consulting engineers Alan Baxter & Associates.

The team has also carried out an exhaustive thematic analysis of the building, including a study of the tower, to understand its place in Wren's oeuvre.

Officers from the City Corporation and English Heritage have been consulted on the results of these investigations, which have been discussed at a series of pre-application meetings held over the autumn/winter of 2002/3. The proposals reflect comments made by officers at these meetings.

### Special Architectural and Historic Interest of the Tower

PPG15 states that an understanding of special architectural and historic interest is essential for the development proposals affecting a listed building.

Here, in the case of a tower, the special interest is derived from its unusual form, overall proportions, and materials. These characteristics are considered in more detail below.

Internally, apart from surviving historic fabric, the tower is notable for its structural features. These include the stone staircase, which winds its way up to the belfry, and the timber in the upper areas of the tower. The tower is in a structurally sound condition but appears to need a level survey. The robustly detailed nature of the tower is considered to be of architectural interest, indicative of late seventeenth-century construction.

The first-floor structure would appear to be later, and the upper floors are of a more recent date. The roof was reconstructed in the late nineteenth century. The overall appearance and proportions of the tower would not appear to be changed by the proposals.

In townscape terms, the Tower adds to the visual interest of this part of the City, dominated by the mass of the Modern buildings. The tower is visible in longer views and from certain areas to the south-east. The distinctive silhouette of the tower—a rare survival of the late Modern—can be seen as a landmark from the east.

The distinctive silhouette enlivens more local views.

### Scheme Description and Benefits: Building Fabric

As it stands, the tower has a number of defects. The most significant of these is the general air of dereliction it projects, which is not helped by its current position, combining to create an impression of neglect.

Structurally it would appear to be sound, except for some areas of the stonework, which show the effects of expanding, internal ironwork. This is a common problem in buildings of this period and may be confirmed by a detailed survey once the building is scaffolded.

In many areas, inappropriate repair techniques have been used, including cementitious mortars. The cementitious mortars have been used to repair the stonework and have caused further problems. In several locations, lime-based mortars have been used, but these have not been used consistently. The cementitious mortars have been used inappropriately with medley experimental materials (brickwork).

Internally, whilst the masonry stonework is generally sound, there are areas of concern. In particular, the stonework has a soft crumbly texture, which is indicative of a lack of maintenance.

The proposals will result in the repair of these defects. The detailed repairs will be agreed subject to relevant conditions on the grant of planning permission.

## 4.0 Conclusions

### Methodology for Bringing Forward the Current Proposals

The proposals have been developed on the basis of a detailed analysis of the building's fabric and condition (both architectural and structural—see statement prepared by consulting engineers Alan Baxter & Associates).

The team has also carried out an exhaustive investigation into the documentary history of the tower, to understand its place in Wren's oeuvre and the changes to it over time.

Officers from the City Corporation and English Heritage have been briefed on the results of these investigations through the design process, at a series of detailed pre-application meetings held over the autumn/winter of 2004-05. The current proposals reflect comments from these professional officers, resulting in a scheme that is fully detailed.

### Special Architectural and Historic Interest of the Tower

PPG15 states that an understanding of special interest is essential to judging the effects of development proposals affecting a listed building.

Here, in the case of a tower, that special interest can be said to consist of the crown of the building, with its tall pinnacles, unusual amongst Wren’s City Churches, and in its overall proportions and materials. The proportions and treatments of openings within the uniform stonework are also an aspect of the structure’s special interest.

Internally, apart from surviving historic fabric, there are a limited number of special features. These include a domical vault to the ground floor and surviving structural timber in the upper areas of the tower, as well as an area of apparently original oak boarding at level seven. The robustly detailed timber door on the west elevation also appears to be an authentic late seventeenth-century design.

The first-floor structure would appear to be later, and there is good evidence that the roof was reconstructed in the late nineteenth century. The timber joinery in the lower parts of the tower would not appear to be original. Many of the stone bell stage louvres are, however.

In townscape terms, the Tower adds to the visual interest of an otherwise bland part of the City, dominated by the machinery of the road. It contributes to several local and longer views, and from certain areas to the south—notably the public viewing points in Tate Modern—can be seen against the backdrop of St. Paul's.

The distinctive silhouette enlivens more local views.

### Scheme Description and Benefits: Building Fabric

As it stands, the tower has a number of defects and unattractive features. First and foremost is the general air of dereliction it projects, which taken in association with its position, combine to create the sense of it being something sad and almost left behind.

Structurally it would appear to be sound except for the pinnacles that may be suffering the effects of expanding, internal iron cramps. The exact condition of the pinnacles needs to be determined by a detailed survey once the scaffolding has been erected.

In many areas, inappropriate repair techniques have been applied in the past and the current treatment of many openings is capable of being improved. For instance, cementitious not lime-based mortar has been used in pointing, rendering and rendering several locations, and former windows and doors have been infilled or rendered in such a way with deeply repoint materials (brickwork and chicken wire).

Internally, whilst the masonry (stone and brick) is in reasonable structural condition, much of the stonework has a soft crumbly surface that is both unattractive and inappropriate in a new residential setting.

The proposals will result in the repair of these defects and the rectification of structural faults identified by the consulting engineers, according to detailed method statements to be agreed subject to relevant conditions on the grant of planning permission and listed building consent.

Insofar as possible, the proposals do not disturb historic fabric. Such fabric as it is proposed to remove (the tower roof and the first-floor structure) are of late nineteenth- or even twentieth-century origins and deemed not to have special interest as historic fabric.

It is required, however, to remove several joists forming part of an original, late seventeenth-century structural floor frame in an upper part of the tower. An original oak boarded floor at level system needs also to be partly removed.

These alterations have been kept to the minimum necessary to enable the installation of a lift mechanism. Every effort has been made on the part of the architects to source a reliable lift of the smallest dimensions practicable. It is argued that this intervention, whilst it does disturb authentic Wren-period fabric, is necessary to install a lift without which the residential use of the entire tower—with the consequent benefits of this outlined elsewhere—would not be possible.

## Scheme Benefits: Use

The principal conservation challenge, then, is finding a viable new use for a structure whose original purpose—bell ringing, ancillary to a church, demolished more than a century ago—has no prospect ever of being reinstated.

Residential use would appear to be both the optimum viable use—because of the unusual configuration of the structure, its modest size and setting amidst the dead commercial frontages of larger-floor plate office buildings. Residential use equally has certain advantages in the sense that it generally requires a lower degree of servicing than other uses.

## Necessary and Desirable Alterations and Insertions

In order to provide easy vertical circulation in the lower stages of the tower, which includes a surviving and elegantly detailed domical porch, the proposals call for the construction of a stair to the north elevation, formed within a rendered Portland stone wall which is a masonry bearing structure supported off its own foundations.

This principle of such a side piece has long been accepted (and approved, albeit now lapsed) by the planning authority and English Heritage, in the context of earlier discussions over proposed residential use (for another prospective owner). The advantages of such a new structure are:

- It enables vertical access to the upper stages of the tower without compromising the spatial form of the domical vaulted entrance spaces.
- It enables separate and more convenient access from the higher ground to the north, direct from the back edge of the existing pavement, helping in the transition of levels.
- It pushes vertical circulation space in the lower levels outside the critical interior and at upper levels provides essential space for kitchen, WCs, and baths on levels 4 through 6.

This side extension relieves pressure on historic fabric and will reduce the subdivision of the new rooms on upper floors to the minimum, essentially a small lift enclosure. The passive stair is able to function as a protected means of escape subject to detailed design measures agreed with the District Surveyor already.

This side piece is fixed to the north elevation of the tower, at the point where it formerly attached to the church. The facing here is relatively modern render.

The design of the side piece has been carefully considered and a suitable construction methodology agreed in order to ensure that it will weather in a way that is consonant with the adjacent tower. The jointing and configuration of blocks have also now been agreed, to ensure that these read as traditional masonry. The design of the new entrance is worked into the proposed stone jointing, ensuring a neat solution to this most important feature.

Elevationally, the side piece is rounded, surmounted by a round tower, understated and kept visually distinct from the glazed slot. The height is similar to mid-level story conjunction than a slightly lower.

There are two further aspects which the principal design constraints, but suitable, have been addressed in the proposals, for townscape and process that will be the same as providing a visual link.

New external joinery will be detailed configuration of the.

The other potential risk when the new inserted floors are that of the external joinery. The proposals have been designed engineer who has any structural risks.

To ensure the safe cleaning of proposed to bespoke solution, glazed at a levels below condition to the new.

An unusual feature of the upper stage. It is proposed a more suitable material to the interior timber and the determination phase due to the worsted condition on the listed treatment.

## Summary

The proposals, then, are compliant with national and local planning policy on the historic environment, and have the added benefit of providing new residential accommodation, which is supported at both national and local levels equally.

This proposed use will in no way prejudice the commercial operations of the surrounding office buildings.

In this instance, given the location and configuration of the property, reuse as a single residential dwelling with scope for ancillary office, the proposed use, provides the most secure and certain future for a building that needs repair and requires ongoing, regular maintenance to preserve its special interest.

**In line with this policy context, the proposals have been developed on the basis of a full understanding of the listed structure's history and condition, established through careful visual/physical and documentary analysis.**

The proposals have also been developed through detailed discussions with the planning authority's conservation advisors and with English Heritage.

Broadly speaking, the works are the minimum necessary to secure the most viable and least damaging solution to the long-term conservation needs of this tower, a structure which otherwise has no prospect of long-term beneficial use. The lack of such a use inevitably puts any historic building at risk, and the proposals are to be welcomed for this reason, as a matter of principle.

The approach to the new side piece—to do something in the manner of traditional building, but to interpret its character in a contemporary way—is also consistent with policy guidance and best practice, which takes a circumspect view towards ersatz or pastiche design. The piece is proposed on the elevation which has already been compromised, where the tower attached originally to the body of the long-demolished church.

The proposals to light the top part of the tower at night, whilst not necessary, are certainly desirable and will have the effect of improving the appearance of an otherwise ordinary part of the City, as well as enhancing the group value with the Ill dome of St. Paul's which forms the backdrop to the Tower in certain views.

The archaeological impacts have been considered, and the City archaeologist is content to handle them by means of a standard condition.

For the above reasons, we consider the proposals respect the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade I listed Tower and are therefore in accordance with statutory planning policy and other material considerations.
