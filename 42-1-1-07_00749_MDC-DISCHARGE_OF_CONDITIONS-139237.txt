Dear Ms Joyce and Mr Cornwell,

## Tower of St Mary Somerset  
211 Upper Thames Street, EC4  
**LPA Refs: 05/00194/FULL and 05/00195/LBC**

Further to our meeting at your Office on 10th August to discuss the discharge of the various conditions relating to the above project, as promised, attached to this letter is our short note arising from our meeting (10/08). Following on from that, I thought it would be useful to update you on the following:

- **Discharge of condition 2a)**: We now enclose a replacement sample of the oak flooring.
- **Discharge of condition 2b)**: No change. We await your approval of the cleaning and repair details submitted — see Topic Paper 1 at Bible II.
- **Discharge of condition 2b) – External lighting**: As agreed at the meeting (see notes) and as an Amendment to Topic Paper 2, we have decided to remove those spotlight proposals that were not agreed and simplified the external lighting down to two small fittings (known as L15) either side of the main entrance. See attached drawings (x6):

#### B) Finishes to Extension to Tower

1. **Floors:** Generally 20mm solid oak / hardwood floor boards; Kitchen and bathroom floors to be Stone, slate or tile.  
2. **Walls:** New walls of Portland Stone; Existing rendered walls of Tower (now part of Interior) to be made good & have plaster skim & painted.

**Conclusions:** Overall, I trust the attached details provide you with all the information you require. As you will be aware, a material start on site that will formally implement the scheme as approved in May 2005, will take place on **28th August 2007**.

As we have indicated before, by letters dated 19th and 25th July, we do of course have a good deal of additional background information on every aspect of the project and would be able to supply you and/or your colleagues in the various departments – surveyors, legal, technical services etc with this information should it be required.

Yours sincerely,

*Richard Greenwood*
