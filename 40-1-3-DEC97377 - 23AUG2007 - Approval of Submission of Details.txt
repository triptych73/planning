## STATEMENT OF APPLICANT'S RIGHTS ARISING FROM THE REFUSAL OF PLANNING PERMISSION OR ON THE GRANT OF PERMISSION SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS

- If you are aggrieved by the decision of your local planning authority to refuse permission for the proposed development or to grant it subject to conditions, then you can appeal to the Secretary of State under Section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

- If you want to appeal, then you must do so within six months of the date of this notice, using a form which you can get from the Planning Inspectorate, Customer Support Unit, Temple Quay House, 2 The Square, Temple Quay, Bristol BS1 6PN (Tel: 0117 372 6372) or downloaded from their website on [www.planning-inspectorate.gov.uk](http://www.planning-inspectorate.gov.uk).

- The Secretary of State can allow a longer period for giving notice of appeal, but he will not normally be prepared to use this power unless there are special circumstances which excuse the delay in giving notice of appeal.

- The Secretary of State need not consider an appeal if it seems to him that the local planning authority could not have granted planning permission for the proposed development or could not have granted it without the conditions they have imposed, having regard to the statutory requirements, to the provisions of any development order and to any directions given under a development order.

- In practice, the Secretary of State does not refuse to consider appeals solely because the local planning authority based their decision on a direction given by him.

### Purchase Notices

- If either the local planning authority or the Secretary of State refuses permission to develop land or grants it subject to conditions, the owner may claim that he can neither put the land to a reasonably beneficial use in its existing state nor render the land capable of a reasonably beneficial use by the carrying out of any development which has or would be permitted. In these circumstances, the owner may serve a purchase notice on the Council (District Council, London Borough Council or Common Council of the City of London) in whose area the land is situated. This notice will require the Council to purchase his interest in the land in accordance with the provisions of Part VI of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
