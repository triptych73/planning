## Notes

Wren's Church Tower of St Mary Somerset in Upper Thames Street was built between 1686-94. It is a grade I listed building on the register of Buildings at Risk.

Planning permission and listed building consent were granted on 12 May 2005 for internal and external alterations and erection of an extension on the north side of the building to provide an additional 190 sqm of floor space in connection with use as a single dwelling house with ancillary office accommodation.

Details of the new stonework facades to the extension and details of all interior finishes, including floors, walls, and doors, were approved on 18 May 2006. Approval is sought for further details and revisions to already approved details to discharge conditions 2a(part), 2c(part), 2e(part), and 2f(part). The revisions are the result of the applicants amending some aspects of the design of the proposed extension. Changes to the overall appearance of the extension would be minimal, and the following additional details and revisions are in accordance with the permitted scheme.

### 1. Conditions 2a(part)

Particulars and samples of the materials to be used on all external surfaces of the building, and 2f(part) Details of new stonework facades to extension.

### 2. Conditions 2a(part)

Particulars and samples of the materials to be used on all external surfaces of the building, 2c(part) Details of new windows and joinery, and 2e(part) Details of junctions between original building and extension. The detail of the vertical strip window between the extension and the tower has been revised. It is proposed that the window frame would abut the stonework of the tower rather than being rebated into a slot that would have been cut into the stonework of the tower as originally approved. Further window section details and samples are to be submitted.

### 3. Condition 2f(part)

Details of new stonework facades to extension. The wall construction has been revised to a steel frame with blockwork infill and 75 mm Portland stone cladding, thermal insulation, and an internal finish of fair-faced render. The external appearance of the extension would be unaltered, and the change is considered to be acceptable.

### 4. Condition 2e(part)

Details of junctions between original building and extension. The staircase within the proposed extension has been replaced by a platform lift. All of the associated plant and machinery for the lift would be accommodated within the extension. The face of the tower in this area would be unaltered as the need for various fixings associated with the staircase would be obviated.

The revised details submitted are considered to be acceptable and in accordance with the approved plans.
