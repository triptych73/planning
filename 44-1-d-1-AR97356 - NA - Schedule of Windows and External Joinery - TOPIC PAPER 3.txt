1. There is some overlap here between the discharge of Condition 2(c) and 2(d) that concerns the proposed double glazed inserts to existing windows to be refurbished [see TOPIC PAPER 4] and also condition 2(e) that concerns the glazed junction between the original and new extension [see conditions schedule].

2. The following Window Table hopefully draws together the approved and proposed treatment:
