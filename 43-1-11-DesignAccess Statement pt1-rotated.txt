# St. Marys, Somerset - Lambeth Hill

## 1.0 Introduction

### Introduction

This report has been prepared on behalf of St Mary Somerset Ltd and their proposals to rescue the Tower of St Mary Somerset; a building of local, national and international significance. The proposals involve the conversion of the tower into a single dwelling. Planning permission and listed building consent was originally granted in 2005 for this Tower that have since been slowly moving forwards with the City Corporation and English Heritage since this period. Permission has recently been renewed.

This report, now represents in one document the historical context of the site and provides an analysis of the current character of the site and the acceptability of the proposals from a conservation perspective.

It will also briefly address the policy context to the proposals; as provided within the City of London UDP (adopted 2002).

### Site and Surroundings

The tower of St Mary Somerset is located on a strip of land bounded by Lambeth Hill to the north and Castle Baynard Street to the south.

The site lies within a predominantly commercial district of the City of London. There are three large office blocks on three sides of the tower; Dominant House, Walker House and the Salvation Army Headquarters. There is a small memorial garden to the east of the church tower.

The tower is all that remains of the former church of St Mary Somerset, which was demolished circa 1870.

The tower is currently vacant and has been so since circa 1975, when it was used by Bernard Miles, the former director of the Mermaid Theatre.

The tower is a Grade I listed building and was listed in 1950. The site does not lie within a Conservation Area. There are no other listed buildings within the immediate vicinity of the site, the nearest being the St Nicholas Cole Abbey Church on the opposite side of Queen Victoria Street from the site.

### Historical Development of the Site and Surroundings

#### Surrounding Area

The area surrounding St Mary Somerset has changed substantially since the 12th century when the church was originally built.

In the 1670s, prior to the Great Fire, the church was surrounded by fairly densely packed buildings. It was located at the junction of Old Fish Street and Upper Thames Street. This pattern of development continued after the Great Fire up until 1871 when Queen Victoria Street opened and cut through much of the old street pattern and buildings.

Goad's insurance map of 1886 shows that Old Fish Street has been adapted and renamed. It runs along the north side of the church and joins with the southern end of Lambeth Hill and Queen Victoria Street. This map also shows that much of the church building had been demolished to make way for more buildings and only the tower remained.

In the 1950s post-war bomb clearance and the widening of Upper Thames Street have left the church tower in an isolated state, with a small garden. By 1970, larger buildings including the Salvation Army Headquarters, were emerging around the church tower.

The present day site is flanked on three sides by large office buildings. The tower is now located on an isolated road junction between Lambeth Hill and Castle Baynard Street, which runs parallel to Upper Thames Street. There is a small memorial garden to the east of the church tower.

# St. Marys, Somerset - Lambeth Hill

## 2.0 Historical Development of the Site and Surroundings

The original church of St Mary Somerset was built circa 1150. There are various interpretations of how it was given its name. One being that it derived its name from Ralph de Somerset, another that it may derive from Sumner's Hill, meaning a small part of a town.

The original church was repaired in 1624 and was subsequently destroyed by the Great Fire of 1666.

The Parish was reportedly one of the poorest in the borough and it was not until 1685 that the church was rebuilt. The church was finished, with the parishioners raising the money to rebuild themselves but not initially. Another western portion of the building was completed circa 1695.

The church was designed by Christopher Wren, with the clerks on the parapet of the tower thought to be modeled on designs by William Kempster, a mason. Other craftsmen thought to be involved in the project were Christopher Kempster, John Evans, Matthew Roberts, James Grove, carpenter; William Cleere, joiner; Charles Hobson, plasterer; Matthew Hurst, plasterer; Thomas Hodgson, smith; Henry Hodges, plasterer; Matthew Hurst, plasterer; Edward Bird, painter; Bartholomew Scott, labourer and clerk; and James Hurst, labourer.

Various repairs were carried out to the church and tower during the 18th and 19th centuries and an order was passed in 1866 which provided for the demolition and sale of St Mary Somerset.

In 1868-1871, the church building was the first church to be demolished under the Union of Benefices Act. The tower was saved by an act of parliament after Edwin Nash, an architect, threatened it. It is thought the tower was kept because of the unusual obelisks on the parapets, which are thought to have been design by Hawksmore.

### Text

In 1875 the church articles, including the bell and pulpit, were loaned to St Mary Horton and the monuments were removed to St Nicholas Cole Abbey. In 1899 the original bell from the church was recast by Mears and Stainbank for St Mary Horton.

The obelisks on the church parapets were removed in the 1940's following the Blitz as they were weakened by blasts, and were to be reinstated later. Cobb's book London City Churches includes that the tower had been used previously as a rest room for women during their lunch hour.

In 1955-56 the Corporation of London carried out major renovations to the church tower, including the reinstatement of the obelisks.

The memorial garden to the east of the church tower was created in the 1960's, by which time the tower was vacant. It is thought to have been used up until 1975, when it was used by Bernard Miles, the former director of the Mermaid Theatre.

### Literary Accounts of the Tower

Niven W. London City Churches destroyed since 1800

"The tower, which diminishes slightly, rises to a height, including its pinnacles of 120ft, and has with the south and west fronts of the church, been incased with Portland Stone. The tower is with its garden of pinnacles another and beautiful variety to the steeples with which Wren decorated this part of London. It is carefully proportioned, and the keystones are carved alternately with grotesque heads and cherubs."

## 2.0 Historical Development of the Site and Surroundings

### Jeffery, Churches of Sir Christopher Wren

"The tower, with pinnacles rising to the height of 120 feet, is faced with Portland Stone. The bell windows are round-headed and variously spaced as masks. The tower is composed with an elaborate main pier and a taper supporting eight panelled pedestals, those at the angles half as broad. Those in the centre of each face have tall obelisks, each with enriched bands and a ball."

### Godwin, Churches of London Vol II

"The tower stands on the southwest corner of the building quite independent of the body of the church, is divided into stories, by plain string courses, the lower portion and a part of the second story, are of plain masonry, the surface is broken by bands, supporting an urn between them, on every side is a simple pediment which bears a small ball, and on each face of the tower eight obelisks. These stand on pedestals, the centre ones being more than double the height of the angles. The windows are circular, with the window openings, are sculptured to represent grotesque heads, certainly not in any degree in character with the prevailing character of the building."

### Cobb, London City Churches

"St Mary Somerset: a remarkable tower; little known or appreciated, and often dismissed by critics. Birch, Stratton and Bumpus as more curious than beautiful.

A line of windows, alternately round-headed and circular, runs up the centre of each side of the highest stage. The base of the church, and the base, is clear, smooth up above the parapets. A tall obelisk on each pedestal, the angles at either end of the parapet, and the central pedestal supports a taller obelisk. All these are beautifully panelled on one, a symmetry from side-faced ivory, rising like water, the morning sun fell on them, they seemed almost transparent, and they thrust up into the blue. When seen from different angles, present remarkably different effects."

### Royal Commission on Historical Monuments London, Vol 4, The City, 1929

**"The interior is quite plain, and has only a flat ceiling, slightly coved, or arched next to the walls, and without any pretensions to architectural character. The small windows near the roof are filled with plain leaded glass, and their window-frames and casings painted the proper stone colour. A wooden Altar on one side, a carved oak pulpit is attached to the south end of the church, and a small gallery at the west end contains an organ, which was erected through the instrumentality of the present rector."**

### Niven, W. London City Churches destroyed since 1800:

"The interior of the church was undisturbed; the ceiling flat in the centre and coved at the sides, the tower being open to the roof. Allen, in 1708, noted that the interior of the church was decorated by hanging the heads of slain enemies. In the early part of the eighteenth century the church was used as a meeting place for the clergy of the diocese, with a painted canvas placed behind the altar-table, in the centre of which was a wooden carving of the Lamb of God. The Ascension of the Lord was represented in the canvas. The altar-table was inscribed as the gift of John Towey, 1699, who also gave the lining of the vestry. 1690 the pulpit was against, and was of hexagonal form, in the west window were the arms of William and Mary."

### Allen, Histories & Antiquities of London

"The south front of the church has 5 arched windows, and the elevation is finished with a cornice. The tower has a brick band and is surmounted by a cornice resting on consoles. The altar is of stone, and has a carved wooden front of the church and from the basement rises an arched doorway surrounded by a cornice resting on consoles; the unpeopled portion has free access to the interior of the three westernmost divisions."

### Allen, Histories & Antiquities of London

"The tower is of stone, and the three fonts which are clear of the church are alike in the basement is an arched doorway surrounded by a cornice resting on consoles; the interior of the church is decorated with a carved wooden front. The western end of the church is decorated with a painted canvas placed behind the altar-table, in the centre of which is a wooden carving of the Lamb of God. The Ascension of the Lord is represented in the canvas. The altar-table is inscribed as the gift of John Towey, 1699, who also gave the lining of the vestry. The pulpit was against, and was of hexagonal form, in the west window were the arms of William and Mary."

**Repairs to the Church**

### Birch, G London Churches of the XVIIIth - VIIIth centuries, 1896:

"Of late years the interior has been cleansed and the roof releaded, the old lead having been melted down and recast, and the roof was made good, though, perhaps, not unnaturally, the lines were ordinary workmanship in replacing."

**The bills with churchwardens' accounts which state that 25 pounds was the "cost of renovation of the tower of St Mary Somerset church as per the resolution of the vestry 6th August 1885".**

### According to churchwardens accounts:

Minor sums were spent on repairs to the church and tower. In the 1770s £44 was spent on bills for the carpenter in mason and £30 spent on the tower. In the intervening years repairs to the tower, although not exceeding great details of what these repairs might have been. In 1725 £24 was spent on repairs and alterations to the church yard.

**Royal Commission on Historical Monuments London, Vol 4, The City, 1929**

"Fittings-doors in the south and west doorways - each of two folds and eight panels, late 17th century."

The planning submission accompanying the application, prepared by Walsbourne Greenwood Development Planning, considers the broad acceptability of the proposals in land-use planning terms with reference to relevant national and Unitary Development Plan policies.

In this section of the heritage report, we consider the relevant conservation policies, both those in PPG15, Planning and the Historic Environment, and appropriate policies in the recently issued PPS1, on Sustainable Development, and PPG3 Housing.

### Planning Policy Statement 1: Sustainable Development (2005)

PPS1 places a high premium on stewardship of the natural and manmade environment, and in terms of planning choices emphasizes the need to ensure that applications, actions, and decisions promote change in a sustainable manner. The document states that local planning authorities should encourage design innovation to solve new or difficult architectural problems (at para. 38) as well as schemes that benefit the environment more widely (para 19).

### Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing

The desirability of making the most efficient use of existing land and structures is a land-use planning point taken up in the separate planning statement. PPG3 on housing specifically encourages local planning authorities to support the reuse of existing land or structures, and the conversion of properties into residential use (at paras. 40 and 41).

The conversion of a structure into a single dwelling - such as proposed in the current application - is not full of the complexity and benefit in the general reuse of most sites. Nevertheless, the proposal is one which is considered to be in the interests of policy in this area, and our view on efficiency (in terms of resources) and threats on this site, which are those arising from lack of maintenance and occupation. The proposal is seen as desirable in housing policy terms, and the heritage benefits of the proposal, as will shortly be discussed.

### Planning Policy Guidance Note 15: Planning and the Historic Environment

It is accepted by the planning authority and English Heritage, which has been closely involved in assessing the proposal, that the site is listed as a building of architectural importance, and forms part of the curtilage of the Grade I listed church, the White church tower.

PPG15 contains government planning policy on the historic environment. Running through this document is a strong emphasis on retention/conservation but in a balanced fashion that considers the particular features or characteristics that contribute to the asset's appeal.

PPG15 states that finding a viable long-term conservation solution for a building is balanced in holding a view that the building should be preserved for its and the building's space interests (paras 3.8 to 3.10). The document also states that a building's reuse is generally viewed as a good thing and that balance is particularly noted with regards to the conversion of listed buildings.

The PPG addresses that applicants for listed building consent must show why their proposals are suitable or necessary and that work is justified by other related applications. The PPG also indicates that such works (particularly on graded buildings) often require specialist advice and consideration by appropriate methodologies and techniques (at para. 3.5). These should be considered during the construction procurement process, subsequent to achieving the necessary consents.

The PPG discusses suitable approaches to extensions, the design of which require careful consideration given the justification already indicated. Broadly the PPG encourages applicants to submit plans for the setting of listed buildings, or other structures, where appropriate. It is noted that this is particularly necessary when the building is in a conservation area or is listed by English Heritage in appropriate situations, subject to detailed design.

### Archaeology

National planning policy on archaeology is contained in PPG16, which describes how archaeological remains are to be considered as a material consideration in planning decisions. This is particularly relevant to the current application given the proximity of the church tower.

### City of London Unitary Development Plan (2002)

For the purposes of determining the present application, the relevant development plan is the City of London's Unitary Development Plan (adopted 2002) Part I and Part II policies.

The UDP policy is consistent, as required with national planning policy. The UDP policies for conservation areas and listed buildings, for example, are consistent with the national approach to conservation and heritage. The UDP also contains policies on housing, which are consistent with the thrust of national accommodation policies at this time.

It is accepted that views of the isolated surviving towers form a particularly important part of the City’s architectural and historical heritage. The UDP notes that many of the routes, such as Pater Square, which is the subject of particular policies, clearly indicate this. It is accepted that the reuse of existing structures is a priority.

The UDP also states that the physical component is also an opportunity to ensuring the preservation of all structures associated with this school.

### Policy STRAT 4 of the London UDP states:

"To maintain a suitable level of housing provision and discourage the loss of residential accommodation in other uses, in accordance with Strategic Guidance."

Paragraph 3.9 goes on to state:

"The Corporation considers that a residential population is of benefit to the City, both functionally and in the context of local vitality and diversity."

### Policy HOUS 1 states:

"To secure the provision of residential accommodation in suitable locations and to resist development where it would result in poor residential amenities or prejudice the City environment."

### Policy ENV 16 relates to:

"To grant consent for the alteration of the exterior or interior of a listed building only where it would not harm its architectural or historic interest."

Paragraph 10.54 goes on to state:

"The adaptation of listed buildings may be necessary to ensure their continued use. Such adaptations should be sensitive and ensure that they are compatible with the character of the building."

### Policy ENV17 relates to:

"To encourage new uses for listed buildings, which are not detrimental to the character or special interest of the building."

## 3.0 Planning Policy Background

### Archaeology

Chapter 11 of the City's UDP contains its policies on scheduled monuments and areas of archaeological interest (effectively most of the City which has not been disturbed by deep basements).

Policy ARC1 requires the assessment of a development site's archaeological interest and potential, and Policies ARC2 and ARC 3 set out requirements for responding to this potential, including the preservation of remains in situ or their recording/publication.

There has been correspondence over the proposals with the City's Archaeological Officer, and it has been agreed that the immediate application does not need an archaeological appraisal on condition that the application is based on a recent watching brief (MoLAS 2003) carried out when a private trench was added to the north of the tower, in the area which it is proposed to disturb to provide foundations for the proposed extension. The church was excavated and published previously by Professor Grimes in 1950.

As a result of this existing information the City Archaeologist has advised that no desk-based assessment is required or predetermination watching. She is content that the limited archaeological potential be handled by means of a standard condition relating to a suitable archaeological method statement. This agreement and the related correspondence is referred to in the supporting planning document.

### Justification for Acceptability of Proposed Residential Use

The church tower has no lawful current use as the ecclesiastical use is considered to have been abandoned following the demolition of the remainder of the church circa 1870. Since the demolition of the church, the tower appears to have been in various uses, however it has been vacant since 1975.

There is no legal definition of 'abandonment', but it is generally accepted that a use has been abandoned where there has been a deliberate decision or intention to cease the use. The demolition of the church has deliberately ceased the remainder of the building and as a result it is considered that any use within the remaining tower has ceased since 1975 and has not resumed since or been subsisting, even if not clearly known, as the building is no longer measured as 'in use'.

Since the site has no lawful use, a viable new use needs to be found in accordance with the principles in PPG15 in which exception is made for the reuse or the upkeep of historic buildings.

PPG15 also states that new uses should usually be the optimum viable use that is compatible with the fabric, interior and setting of the building. The building is of little architectural or aesthetic interest and the usability of the tower is very constrained, limiting its reuse whilst retaining the historic features of the building.

The City of London UDP supports the introduction of residential uses, where satisfactory accommodation can be achieved. Mixed use is still an important commercial area. Government guidance also supports the introduction of mixed use environments, where uses can exist side by side without detriment to the amenity of residential occupiers. The introduction of residential use into the City of London is considered to be a valuable addition to the environment, as it provides a wider choice of uses. The site is within the section of 'Globe View' designated as 'Mixed Use: Lower Thames Street', therefore except by future statement, the site is considered suitable for a mixed use environment and residential development. The introduction of residential use into the City is considered to be a valuable addition to the environment and the site is considered suitable for residential purposes as it will not prejudice the environment based on the City.

Accordingly, it is considered that the proposal to convert the church tower to residential use is completely in accordance with both Government guidance and the policies within the UDP.

## 4.0 Conclusions

### 4.0 Scheme Assessment and Justification

#### General Description of Proposals and Scheme Benefits

The proposals are for the conversion of the former bell tower into a single dwelling, as set out in the application documents and appendices. As part of these proposals, building works to the tower will be repaired and cleaned in places. Openings will be very carefully considered and sympathetically treated in the approach proposed to the lighting of the unit. Unusually shaped finials have been removed.

Giving such a structure a new purpose - be it residential or office - necessarily entails a range of changes, alterations for services, systems to combat fire, access improvements, and so on.

It is considered that the scale and configuration of the tower, as well as its location, effectively rules out any other use which is likely to be desirable, let alone viable. The scheme is also intended to improve the overall environment by removing redundant and neglected uses and features which detract from the building's setting. Simple residential use also maintains the structure overall as an entity, and the particular scheme by bringing into the wider available part of the tower makes it more likely that the building as a whole will be maintained and kept sound and secure.

The consequent requirements for this new use are:

- Changes to the treatment of existing opening.
- Need for alternative means of escape.
- Need for efficient and relatively easy vertical circulation by means of new stairs and a lift (given the considerable height of the tower).
- The insertion of new floors and creation of new spaces.
- The insertion of building services.
- A new interface with the public realm (bin stores, for example).
- Measures to protect the amenity of the residents, taking into account the largely commercial character of the surroundings (see following paragraph) and the noise of traffic along Lower Thames Street.

There is a particular UDP policy issue with the provision of residential accommodation in this location, noted by HOUS1. This notes that the "City's commercial accommodation is a desirable location for residential use."

Whilst the tower is located in a predominantly commercial area, it is not entirely private in these uses. It suffers from surrounding buildings and by the sheer mass of them. The church is used for services, and the churchyard is a small garden, but they provide a buffer between the tower and the nearest commercial uses.

We consider, notwithstanding the above factors, that potential conflict with HOUS1 is unlikely to arise. The building currently has a commercial use which is to be removed, and the introduction of a residential use will not lead to any more intensification of use. The building is listed. In terms of scale there are no changes to the building envelope other than those set out elsewhere in this report. The new use is considered beneficial in that it will remove the tower from a neglected and deteriorating architectural environment. Its use will lead to a reflection of its high grade, resulting not least from its association with Sir Christopher Wren.

#### Note on Archaeology

This is discussed in section 3.0 above and in the cover note accompanying the application. As stated the City archaeologist is content for the archaeological potential of the site to be handled by means of a condition attached to the planning permission, requiring an archaeological method statement to be implemented during the construction procurement phase of the project.

### Methodology for Bringing Forward the Current Proposals

The proposal has been developed on the basis of a detailed analysis of the building's fabric and condition (both architectural and structural) - see statement prepared by conservation engineers Alan Baxter & Associates.

The team have also carried out an exhaustive investigation into the documentary history of the tower to understand its place in Wren's oeuvre and the changes to it over time.

Officers from the City Corporation and English Heritage have been briefed on the proposals, and have expressed general support for the scheme as a beneficial re-use of the tower. The proposals have been developed in consultation with the City Planning Department and English Heritage, resulting in a scheme that is fully supported.

#### Special Architectural and Historic Interest of the Tower

PPG15 states that an understanding of special interest is essential to judging the effects of development proposals affecting a listed building.

Herein, in the case of a tower, that special interest can be said to consist of the crown of the building with its parapets and finials, the unornamented Wren's City churches, and the bell provision with associated structures. Amongst these are changes of openings with the uniform stonework is also an aspect of the structure's special interest.

Externally, apart from surviving historic fabric, there are a limited number of special features. These include the stonework of the bell tower and its finials. Internally, there is little surviving historic fabric. The tower is a simple and elegant oval base supporting a rectangular stone tower. The design is based on earlier Wren towers and is of architectural interest in its own right.

The first-floor structure would appear to be later, but there is good evidence that the tower was constructed in the late 17th century. The changes to the tower over time have not affected the relationship between the church and the tower, although the tower is now somewhat isolated.

In townscape terms the Tower adds to the visual interest of an otherwise bland part of the City. Its prominence and the "machinery" of the structure make it an important landmark. The tower is visible from the City's public viewing points in the Monument, London Bridge, and St. Paul's.

The distinctive silhouette enhances more local views.

#### Scheme Description and Benefits: Building Fabric

As it stands the tower has a number of defects and unattractive features. First and foremost, it is in need of repair. The stonework is in need of cleaning and attention. The existing roof is in need of replacement. The existing stair is small and inefficient but is not suitable for the proposed use. The existing floors are in need of replacement.

The proposals will result in the repair of these defects and the rectification of structural inadequacies. The insertion of new floors and the creation of new spaces will be carried out in accordance with current best practice. The proposals will result in the removal of redundant and unattractive features. The internal arrangement will be improved, and the building will be brought back into beneficial use.

## 4.0 Conclusions

Insider as possible the proposals do not disturb historic fabric. Such fabric as it is proposed to remove (the tower roof and the first floor structure) are of late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century origins and deemed not to have special interest as historic fabric.

It is required, however, to remove several joists forming part of an original late seventeenth-century structure from an upper floor of the tower. An original oak board floor at level 1/2m exists at this level and is partly removed.

These alterations have been kept to the minimum necessary to enable the installation of a reliable means of escape from this ancient part of the tower. The removal of a small number of timber elements has been necessary to enable the installation of a modern dumb-waiter lift in the new side piece. It is considered that this work, which is reversible under the present floor levels, has the consequent benefits of this outlined elsewhere - would not be contentious.

### Scheme Benefits: Use

The principal conservation challenge, then, is finding a viable new use for a structure whose original purpose - bell ringing ancillary to a church, demolished more than a century ago - has no prospect of ever being reinstated.

Residential use would appear to be both the optimum viable use - because of the unusual configuration of the structure, its modest size and setting amidst the dead commercial frontages of large-floor office buildings. Residential use also presents other advantages in the sense that it generally requires a less demanding servicing than other uses.

### Necessary and Desirable Alterations and Insertions

In order to provide easy vertical circulation in the lower stages of the tower, which includes a surviving early eighteenth-century wall portion, the proposals include the construction of a stair to the north elevation, formed with a solid Portland stone wall which is a masonry bearing structure supported off continuous foundations.

This principle (such a side piece has been accepted in the past and even encouraged by the planning authority and English Heritage, in the context of new alterations or proposed alterations to other historic buildings elsewhere). The advantages of such a present structure are:

- It enables vertical access to the upper stages of the tower without compromising the spatial form of the demic vaults.
- It enables separate and more convenient access from the higher ground to the north, direct from the back edge of the existing pavement, helping in the transition of levels.
- It pushes vertical circulation space to the exterior of the tower interior and upper levels provide essential space for kitchen, WCs and baths on levels 4 through 6.

This side extension relieves pressure on historic fabric and enables the construction of new rooms on upper floors to the minimum necessary to suit the structure. The primary result is able to function as a house, subject to the inclusion of design measures agreed with the District Surveyor.

This side piece is fixed to the north elevation of the tower, at the point where it formerly attached to the church. The fabric here is relatively modern.

The design of the side piece has been carefully considered by a suitable construction methodology agreed in order to construct it, and to have the least possible impact on the historic tower. The new piece is fixed by a bolt and plate construction, which is inserted into the proposed stone joining, ensuring a neat solution to this most important feature.

Elevationally the side piece reproduces the pattern and configuration of openings (a favoured outcome) but is a north-facing light. The stone and architectural expression, however, understand and contemporary and to ensure that the building archaeology is not lost. The height of the new side piece is set by the level of the existing eaves, and is similar to the height of the tower. The new piece is carefully constructed in conjunction with a slightly lower structure.

There are two further external changes that warrant comment. The first is the proposed removal of a redundant chimney stack. The second concerns the level of the side piece, which is elevated to provide a level access from the first floor of the tower, and is set at the same level as the existing floor.

## 4.0 Conclusions

In line with this policy context, the proposals have been developed on the basis of a full understanding of the listed structure's history and condition, established through careful visual/physical and documentary analysis.

The proposals have also been developed through detailed discussions with the planning authority's conservation advisors and with English Heritage.

Broadly speaking, the works are the minimum necessary to secure the most viable and least damaging solution to the long-term conservation needs of the tower — a structure which otherwise has no purpose of long-term beneficial use. The lack of such a use inevitably puts any historic building at risk, and the proposals are to be welcomed for this reason, as a matter of principle.

The approach to the new side piece is to do something in the manner of traditional building, but to interpret its character in a contemporary way. It also connects with policy guidance and best practice in terms of new development work towards craft or pastiche design. The piece is proposed on the elevation which has already been compromised, where the tower attached originally to the body of the long-demolished church.

The proposal to light the top part of the tower at night, whilst not necessary are certainly desirable and will have the effect of improving the appearance of an otherwise ordinary part of the City, as well as enhancing the group value with the lit dome of St. Paul's which forms the backdrop to the Tower in certain views.

The archaeological impacts have been considered, and the City archaeologist is content to handle them by means of a standard condition.

For the above reasons, we consider the proposals respect the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade I listed Tower and are therefore in accordance with statutory planning policy and other material considerations.
