## 1.0 Introduction

### Introduction

This report has been prepared on behalf of St Mary Somerset Ltd and their proposals to rescue the Tower of St Mary Somerset - a building of national and perhaps international significance and allow conversion for residential use. St Mary Somerset was declared redundant in 1955 and the church was demolished following bomb damage in the Second World War. The Tower itself has never been seriously damaged and remains largely complete with an English interior which was fitted in 1705. It is now in the ownership of the City Corporation and has been vacant since 1975.

This report, now in expansion in draft document the historical context of the site and provides an analysis of the current character of the site and the acceptability of the proposals from a conservation perspective.

It will also briefly address the policy context to the proposals; as provided within the City of London UDP (adopted 2002).

### Site and Surroundings

The tower of St Mary Somerset is located on a strip of land bounded by Lambeth Hill to the north and Castle Baynard Street to the south.

The site lies within a predominantly commercial district of the City of London. There are three large office blocks on three sides of the tower, Dominant House, Walker House and the Salvation Army Headquarters. There is a small memorial garden to the east of the church tower.

The tower is all that remains of the former church of St Mary Somerset, which was demolished circa 1870.

The tower is currently vacant and has been so since circa 1975, when it was used by Bernard Miles, the former director of the Mermaid Theatre.

The tower is a Grade I listed building and was listed in 1950. The site does not lie within a Conservation Area. There are no other listed buildings within the immediate vicinity of the site, the nearest being the St Nicholas Cole Abbey Church on the opposite side of Queen Victoria Street from the site.

## 2.0 Historical Development of the Site and Surroundings

### Historical Development of the Site and Surroundings

#### Surrounding Area

The area surrounding St Mary Somerset has changed substantially since the 12th century when the church was originally built.

In the 1670s, prior to the Great Fire, the church was surrounded by fairly densely packed buildings. It was located at the junction of Old Fish Street and Upper Thames Street. This pattern of development continued after the Great Fire up until 1871 when Queen Victoria Street opened and cut through much of the old street pattern and buildings.

Goad's insurance map of 1886 shows that Old Fish Street has been adapted and renamed as part of Knightrider Street. This map also shows that the site of the church was bounded on two sides by large buildings and that much of the old church building had been demolished to make way for more buildings and only the tower remained.

In the 1950s post war bomb clearance and the widening of Upper Thames Street have left the church tower in an isolated state, with a small garden. By 1970, larger buildings including the Salvation Army Headquarters, were emerging around the church tower.

The present day site is flanked on three sides by large office buildings. The tower is now located on an isolated road junction between Lambeth Hill and Castle Baynard Street, which runs parallel to Upper Thames Street. There is a small memorial garden to the east of the church tower.

### The Site

The original church of St Mary Somerset was built circa 1150. There are various interpretations of how it was given its name. Some argue that it derived its name from Ralph de Somerset, another that it may derive from Somersetâ€™s in the meaning a small part of heaven.

The original church was repaired in 1524 and was subsequently destroyed by the Great Fire of 1666.

The Parish was reportedly one of the poorest in the borough and it was not until 1685 that the church was rebuilt. The church was finished, when the Parishioners petitioned Christopher Wren to rebuild the church on its original site. The work on the building was completed circa 1695.

The church was designed by Christopher Wren, with the clerks on the parapet of the tower thought to be designed by his assistant Nicholas Hawksmore. The stone for the church was reputedly drawn by William Kempster, a mason. Other craftsmen thought to be involved in the project were Christopher Kempster, masons; John Ewen, Matthew Roberts, joiner; carpenters, William Chivers, joiner; Charles Hobson, plasterer; Matthew Hurst, plumber; Thomas Hodgkins, smith; Henry Hopgood, plasterer; Matthew Hurst, plaster; Edward Bird, painter; Bartholomew Scott, labourer and carter; and James Jarman, labourer.

Various repairs were carried out to the church and tower during the 18th and 19th centuries and an order was passed in 1866 which provided for the demolition and sale of St Mary Somerset.

In 1868-1871, the Church building was the first church to be demolished under the Union of Benefices Act. The tower was saved by an act of parliament after Edwin Nash, an architect, threatened it. It is thought the tower was kept because of the unusual obelisks on the parapets, which are thought to have been design by Hawksmore.

### Literary Accounts of the Tower

**Niven W. London City Churches destroyed since 1800**

"The tower, which diminishes slightly, rises to a height, including its pinnacles of 120ft, and has with the south and west fronts of the church, an interior wall faced with Portland Stone. The tower is with its garden of pinnacles as another and beautiful variety to the steeples with which Wren decorated this part of London. It is carefully proportioned, and the keystones are carved alternately with grotesque heads and cherubs."

### Jeffery, Churches of Sir Christopher Wren

"The tower, with pinnacles rising to the height of 120 feet, is faced with Portland Stone. The bell windows are round-headed and variously carved as masks. The tower is completed with an elaborate balustrade, the taper supporting eight panelled pedestals, those at the angles having vases. Those in the centre of each face have tall obelisks, each with enriched bands and a ball."

### Godwin, Churches of London Vol II

"The tower stands on the southwest corner of the building quite independent of the body of the church, is divided into stories, by plain string courses, for stone bands; it is supported by an embattled basement on each side, the string rises a few inches, and forming an unbroken line, extends on every side as a simple pedestal; when leaves are carved over the window openings, are sculptured to represent grotesque heads, certainly not in any degree in character with the prevailing character of the building."

### Cobb, London City Churches

"'St Mary Somerset: a remarkable tower, little known or appreciated, and often dismissed by critics. Birch, Stratton and Bumpus as more curious than beautiful.

A line of windows alternately round-headed and circular runs up the centre of each side of the tower. The tall base of the church, masked, as it were, almost up to the parapet in a plain mass of Portland stone, the angles of the tower are strengthened above the panels and the perfect square of each compartment. All these are beautifully panelled on one, a symmetry seldom so-like carved ivory, while just under the moulding is an urn from them, sharply, precise ornamental finials rising up into the blue. When seen from different angles, they present remarkably different effects."

"A structural description - The tower adjoined the church at the southwest angle and is of chequer, but internally and external divisions do not correspond. The cross-stage is a square in plan, the internal divisions of the tower are formed by four columns carrying a cornice and balustrade. The tower is divided into four stages, the lower stage is occupied by a door in each wall, the second stage by a window in each face, and the third stage by a window in each face, the fourth stage by a window in each face, and the fifth stage by a window in each face.
