## Types of Survey

There are two different types of survey: **Management Surveys** and **Refurbishment and Demolition Surveys**.

The type of survey will vary during the lifespan of the premises and several may be needed over time. A management survey will be required during the normal occupation and use of the building to ensure continued management of the ACMs in situ. A refurbishment or demolition survey will be necessary when the building (or part of it) is to be upgraded, refurbished, or demolished. It is probable that at larger premises a mixture of survey types will be appropriate. In later years, refurbishment surveys may be required in rooms or floors which are being upgraded.

### Management Survey

A management survey is the standard survey. Its purpose is to locate, as far as reasonably practicable, the presence and extent of any suspect ACMs in the building which could be damaged or disturbed during normal occupancy, including foreseeable maintenance and installation, and to assess their condition.

### Refurbishment and Demolition Survey

A refurbishment and demolition survey is needed before any refurbishment or demolition work is carried out. This type of survey is used to locate and describe, as far as reasonably practicable, all ACMs in the area where the refurbishment work will take place or in the whole building if demolition is planned.

---

## Duty Holders Use of Survey

The survey report needs to meet the requirements of the client and comply with the tender/contractual obligations. The report should be fit for purpose and the client should check that this is the case.

### The client/duty holder should do to check the accuracy of the survey report

- Check the report against the original tender.
- Check for unagreed caveats or disclaimers.
- Check that the survey is as requested: Management or refurbishment/demolition (or a combination).
- Check diagrams and plans are clear and accurate.
- Check all rooms and areas have been accessed.
- Check sufficient samples have been taken and that sample numbers are not disproportionate.
- Check for any obvious discrepancies and inconsistencies.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1

An Asbestos Refurbishment Survey of the premises was carried out on behalf of Saint Mary Somerset Tower. The survey and all sampling were carried out in accordance with the requirements of the HSE document ‘Surveying, sampling and assessment of asbestos containing material’ HSG 264.

### 1.2 Scope of Works

The scope of works was to carry out an Asbestos Refurbishment Survey to a detached tower over six floors.

### 1.3

The areas described in the scope of works were surveyed at the time of the survey. Please refer to the specific exclusions/non-accessed table below for areas not included in this survey.

### 1.4 Site Description

The property consists of a detached tower over six floors. The approximate age of the property is 1600s and is constructed of masonry stonework and brickwork, metal rainwater goods, lead-lined flat roof.

### 1.5 Specific Exclusions/Non-Accessed

| Floor                              | Room | Description      | Reason                                                                 | Photo |

### 1.6 Specific exclusions relating to surveying

#### 1.6.1

Samples have not been taken where the act of sampling would endanger the Surveyor or affect the functional integrity of the item concerned.

#### 1.6.2

No inspection of live electrical or mechanical plant or similar requiring the attendance of a specialist engineer was carried out.

#### 1.6.3

No inspection of any area requiring specialist access equipment other than stepladders was carried out.

#### 1.6.4

No report has been made on any concealed spaces which may exist within the fabric of the building where the extent and presence of these is not evident due to inaccessibility or insufficient knowledge of the structure of the building at the time of the survey.

#### 1.6.5

Any area not accessed (and where no other information exists) must be presumed to contain asbestos and be managed on that basis.

#### 1.6.6

No inspection of any area deemed unsafe (e.g. fire damaged premises) or where access was physically impractical was carried out.

### 1.7 Specific exclusions relating to sampling

#### 1.7.1

Samples have not been taken where the act of sampling would endanger the Surveyor or affect the functional integrity of the item concerned.

#### 1.7.2

Samples have not been taken where prohibited by the client.

#### 1.7.3

Samples have been taken from all materials which, upon initial visual inspection, appeared to contain asbestos with the exception of some items of mastic, resin or rubber.

#### 1.7.4

Materials have been referred to as Asbestos Insulation Board or Asbestos Cement based on their asbestos content and visual appearance alone.

### 1.8 Caveat

Every effort has been made to identify all asbestos materials so far as was reasonably practical to do so within the scope of the survey and attached report.

## 2. Recommendations

### 2.1

The recommendations detailed in the register in Appendix A are based on each item’s potential for releasing fibres as described in the Health and Safety Executive guideline HSG 264.

### 2.2

A quantifiable assessment of the risk of fibre release has been made by using an algorithm which takes into account all factors relevant to the item and the normal activities of the building occupants.

#### 2.2.1 Definition of terms

- **Enclosure** - Provision of a physical barrier to provide mechanical protection of the material to prevent it being disturbed or damaged.
- **Encapsulation** - Provision of paint type coating to create a continuous seal to the surface of the material and thereby prevent fibre release.
- **Labelling** - Fixing of labels to the surface of the material to warn of the hazard.
- **Registering** - Entering the details, including type, location and extent in a register which is brought to the attention of all persons who might plan or undertake works in the building.
- **Periodic** - Inspection of the material at defined intervals to check that its condition hasn’t deteriorated to require enclosure, encapsulation or removal.
- **Repair** - Addition of a seal to the material to prevent the further deterioration of the material. Carried out in conjunction with labelling.
- **Removal** - Complete removal of a material in compliance with CAWR 1998.
- **Manage in situ** - a policy of regular inspections to ensure that the ACM is maintained in good condition.

## 3. Material Assessment Algorithm

In the material assessment process, the main factors influencing fibre release are given a score which can then be added together to obtain a material assessment rating.

### Materials with Assessment Scores

| Description                                                | Score | Potential    |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------|
| Scores of 4 or less have a very low potential to release fibres | <4    | Very Low     |
| Scores of 5 and 6 a low potential                          | 5-6   | Low          |
| Scores of between 7 and 9 are regarded as having a medium potential | 7-9   | Medium       |
| Scores of 10 or more are rated as having a high potential to release fibres | 10+   | High         |
| Non-asbestos materials are not scored                      | 0     | Not Recorded |
