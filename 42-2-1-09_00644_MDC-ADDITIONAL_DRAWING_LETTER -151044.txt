Dear Sir,

**St Mary Somerset Tower, Approvals Ref. 05/0194 FULL and 0500195 LB**

Further to our telephone conversation yesterday, please find enclosed a second copy of our application for approval of reserved details (as the application of 7th August appears to have been lost in the post).

In addition to the previous documents we have provided, as requested, an additional drawing (A1 drawing SMS / 101) showing the location and site plan.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

Yours faithfully,

**Brian Hendry**
