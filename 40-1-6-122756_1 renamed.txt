## What is it like to attend this early years setting?

**The provision is outstanding**

The manager and staff provide an excellently planned environment and curriculum for the children. Staff are great role models, interacting clearly and enthusiastically with the children throughout the playgroup session. Children are confident, highly motivated, and eager to join in the activities. The children communicate well, and children who speak English as an additional language are fully supported to help them develop their communication skills. The staff know and nurture the children really well. They understand the children's development and interests fully and plan activities that continually excite the children and feed their natural curiosity. The children have the opportunity to explore the community around them, benefiting from the museums and exhibitions close by.

The staff teach the children about healthy eating and what is good for them. The children and staff are very friendly, and children are exceptionally well behaved. Staff provide excellent support to ensure that the children flourish, become independent, and show increasing curiosity in their learning. The children are given appropriate risks to help them develop further, for example, they learn how to use the staircases and bridges in the area safely. Staff are so warm and caring and provide loving comfort to children who need it, allowing the children to feel exceptionally safe and secure. The children demonstrate high levels of self-control and kindness. Staff are very observant and take action quickly to remind children of the playgroup rules.

## What does the early years setting do well and what does it need to do better?

- The setting provides a rich learning environment, where children have the opportunity to thrive and flourish. They are offered a range of activities that ensure they are accessing a broad curriculum across all areas of learning. A strong focus on the children's personal, social, and emotional development underpins the work of the skilled practitioners. This means that children become confident learners and are exceptionally well prepared for the next stage in their learning. The children are offered an excellent range of resources and activities that keep them active, engaged, and help them to build on their knowledge and learning through meaningful play.

- An excellent partnership with parents is in place. The parents speak so highly of the setting and cannot praise the staff enough. They comment on how the children are fully supported and always learning new things. The staff settle any new children with great care, ensuring they have a rounded understanding of their individual needs before they start. Parents are highly positive about the effective ongoing communication between the highly valued staff and themselves. Staff work closely as a team and put the needs and interests of the children and families first at all times. Relationships between everyone involved with the playgroup are respectful and warm.

- The manager has established excellent relationships with schools, which helps to provide a smooth transition for the children and parents. She understands the importance of supporting the whole family, and many older children choose to return and visit the playgroup once they have left.

- Literacy and mathematical development are fully embedded throughout the setting. The staff frequently sing songs and use a large range of rich vocabulary. The use of repetition, rhythm, rhyme, and actions make activities more memorable, exciting, and engaging for the children. This ensures their new knowledge is secure.

- The staff are very skilled at playing alongside children and know when to intervene to extend children's learning. They use various effective teaching methods to support the children in their learning. They are always at the children's level and readily available to support them. The staff take every opportunity to engage with and observe the children as they play. They have an excellent understanding of what each child needs next. The staff understand how the children learn and plan activities which build on children's experiences so that they can remember more.

## Safeguarding

The arrangements for safeguarding are effective.

Children are supported well to ensure they are kept safe. Staff have a thorough understanding of the robust procedures in place to keep children safe within the nursery and when on outings. They are alert to the signs which might indicate a child is at risk and know how to report any concerns. The building is clean, safe, and in a secure location. The provider ensures all staff undergo safeguarding training and keeps their own safeguarding knowledge current.
