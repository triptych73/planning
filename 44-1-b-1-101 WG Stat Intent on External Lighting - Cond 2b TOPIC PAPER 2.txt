## Topic Paper 2

### Tower of St Mary Somerset  
211 Upper Thames Street, London EC 4

**Statement of Intent on External Lighting**  
To discharge part of Condition 2 (b)

**LPA refs: 05/00194/FULL and 05/00195/LBC**

1. Consideration has been given to whether the Grade I Tower should be lit at all. However, in May 2005 consent was given to drawing GA 030 that illustrates how the pinnacles could be lit by way of "zero maintenance micro LED floodlights."

2. The principle was again approved on 18th May 2006 (LPA ref: 06/00283/LDC) and reference was made to two types of external lighting "L11 and L15." Supporting information, not expressly approved, indicates that:
   - **L11** would be an ERCO Beamer light
   - **L15**: BEGA wall luminaires were proposed to be located either side of all ground floor doors.

3. Full details are now submitted with this Topic Paper and the suggested specifications are:
   - **L11** – ERCO BEAMER II Projector with mounting plate for metal halide lamps 35 watt with sculpture pens (see full specification attached)
   - **L15** – BEGA wall luminaire 50 Watts (see full specification attached)
