## Notes

Wren’s Church Tower of St Mary Somerset in Upper Thames Street was built between 1686-94. It is a grade I listed building on the register of Buildings at Risk.

Planning permission and listed building consent were granted 12 May 2005 for internal and external alterations and erection of an extension on the north side of the building to provide an additional 190 sqm of floor space in connection with use as a single dwelling house with ancillary office accommodation. Details of the new stonework facades to the extension and details of all interior finishes, including floors, walls and doors were approved 18 May 2006.

Approval is sought for details as required by conditions 2a, b, c, d, g and h. Samples and details of materials to be used on external and internal surfaces have been submitted, including a sample of Portland Whitbed Stone and solid oak. The samples and particulars of internal finishes are considered acceptable.

### The Methodology for Cleaning

The methodology for the cleaning proposes a test patch with a light water-based clean and the use of soft brushes where necessary. No abrasive or chemical-based methods are proposed and the intent is to achieve a very light, subtle clean, removing only the worst of the dirt. This method is considered acceptable and appropriate for the building.

### Proposed Lighting

The proposed lighting for the building has been amended to include small metal light fittings to either side of the main entrance only. This is considered to be a subtle lighting scheme with visually non-intrusive light fittings.

### Details of New Metal Framed Windows

Details of the new metal framed windows, including the double glazed inserts to the round windows, and details of the new glazed roof light are considered to be acceptably designed and in compliance with the original approved scheme.

The details submitted are considered to be acceptable and in accordance with the approved plans.
