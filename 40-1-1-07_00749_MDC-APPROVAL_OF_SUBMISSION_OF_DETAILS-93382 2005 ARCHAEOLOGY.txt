## Statement of Applicant's Rights Arising from the Refusal of Planning Permission or on the Grant of Permission Subject to Conditions

- If you are aggrieved by the decision of your local planning authority to refuse permission for the proposed development or to grant it subject to conditions, then you can appeal to the Secretary of State under Section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
- If you want to appeal, then you must do so within six months of the date of this notice, using a form which you can get from the Planning Inspectorate, Customer Support Unit, Temple Quay House, 2 The Square, Temple Quay, Bristol BS1 6PN (Tel: 0117 372 6372) or downloaded from their website on [www.planning-inspectorate.gov.uk](http://www.planning-inspectorate.gov.uk).
- The Secretary of State can allow a longer period for giving notice of appeal, but he will not normally be prepared to use this power unless there are special circumstances which excuse the delay in giving notice of appeal.
- The Secretary of State need not consider an appeal if it seems to him that the local planning authority could not have granted planning permission for the proposed development or could not have granted it without the conditions they have imposed, having regard to the statutory requirements, to the provisions of any development order and to any directions given under a development order.
- In practice, the Secretary of State does not refuse to consider appeals solely because the local planning authority based their decision on a direction given by him.

## Purchase Notices

- If either the local planning authority or the Secretary of State refuses permission to develop land or grants it subject to conditions, the owner may claim that he can neither put the land to a reasonably beneficial use in its existing state nor render the land capable of a reasonably beneficial use by the carrying out of any development which has or would be permitted. In these circumstances, the owner may serve a purchase notice on the Council (District Council, London Borough Council or Common Council of the City of London) in whose area the land is situated. This notice will require the Council to purchase his interest in the land in accordance with the provisions of Part VI of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

**12 August 2005**

Dear Kathryn,

**Re: St Mary Somerset, Evaluation Proposals**

I wrote on 23rd May 2005, submitting four copies of the method statement for archaeological evaluation at St Mary Somerset, Lambeth Hill.

In my letter I stated that the method statement was being submitted in support of the Planning Application for the conversion of the tower for residential purposes (reference Registered Plan No. 05/00194/FULL). I understand that the application had in fact been granted planning permission on 12 May 2005 and therefore the letter should have stated that the method statement was being submitted pursuant to the archaeological planning conditions placed on the development.

Yours sincerely,

**Sophie Jackson**  
Senior Project Manager

# Method Statement © MoLAS

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Site Background

This **Method Statement for an archaeological evaluation** on the site of St Mary Somerset, Lambeth Hill, London has been commissioned from the Museum of London Archaeology Service (MoLAS) by Boyarsky Murphy Architects.

The site comprises the garden and remaining tower of St Mary Somerset Church and is bounded by Lambeth Hill on the north side, and Castel Baynard Street to the south (See Fig 1). The centre of the site lies at National Grid reference 532163 180880. Modern pavement level near to the site lies at c 8.56m OD. The existing ground floor slab within the church tower lies at approximately 7.30m OD.

The proposed redevelopment involves the conversion of the St. Mary Somerset Tower for residential use. The works considered in this document are the excavation of a trial trench to the north of the tower and an internal trial pit within the tower (see Fig 2 for trench locations).

The excavations will be monitored by a MoLAS Senior Archaeologist. The results of the trial trench and pit will inform the construction design and the mitigation strategy for any archaeological remains identified.

### 1.2 Planning and Legislative Framework

A Planning Application has been made for the proposed redevelopment (Registered Plan No 05/00194/FULL). The results of the archaeological evaluation will inform the consideration of the planning application by the Corporation of London.

#### 1.2.1 Planning Policy Guidance (PPG16)

The then Department of the Environment published its **Archaeology and planning: a consultative document**, Planning Policy Guidance Note 16 (PPG 16), in November 1990. This set out the Secretary of State’s policy on archaeological remains on land, and provided recommendations many of which have been integrated into local development plans. The key points in PPG16 are the following:

- Archaeological remains should be seen as a finite and non-renewable resource, and in many cases highly fragile and vulnerable to damage and destruction. Appropriate management is therefore essential to ensure that they survive in good condition. In particular, care must be taken to ensure that archaeological remains are not needlessly or thoughtlessly destroyed.
- They can contain irreplaceable information about our past and the potential for an increase in future knowledge. They are part of our sense of national identity and are valuable both for their own sake and for their role in education, leisure and tourism.

**Method Statement © MoLAS**

Where nationally important archaeological remains, whether scheduled or not, and their settings, are affected by a proposed development there should be a presumption in favour of their physical preservation.

The key to informed and reasonable planning decisions is for consideration to be given early, before formal planning applications are made, to the question of whether archaeological remains are known to exist on a site where development is planned and the implications for the development proposal.

When important remains are known to exist, or when archaeologists have good reason to believe that important remains exist, developers will be able to help by preparing sympathetic designs using, for example, foundations which avoid disturbing the remains altogether or minimise damage by raising ground levels under a proposed new structure, or by careful siting of landscaped or open areas. There are techniques available for sealing archaeological remains underneath buildings or landscaping, thus securing their preservation for the future even though they remain inaccessible for the time being.

If physical preservation **in situ** is not feasible, an archaeological excavation for the purposes of 'preservation by record' may be an acceptable alternative. From an archaeological point of view, this should be regarded as a second-best option. Agreements should also provide for the subsequent publication of the results of any excavation programme.

Decisions by planning authorities on whether to preserve archaeological remains **in situ**, in the face of proposed development, have to be taken on merit, taking account of development plan policies and all other material considerations – including the importance of the remains – and weighing these against the need for development.

Planning authorities, when they propose to allow development which is damaging to archaeological remains, must ensure that the developer has satisfactorily provided for excavation and recording, either through voluntary agreement with the archaeologists or, in the absence of agreement, by imposing an appropriate condition on the planning permission.

PPG16 itself forms part of an emerging European framework which recognises the importance of the archaeological and historic heritage in consideration of development proposals. This has recently been formulated in the **Code of good practice on archaeological heritage in urban development policies** established by the Cultural Heritage Committee of the Council of Europe, and adopted at the 15th plenary session in Strasbourg on 8-10 March 2000 (CC-PAT [99] 18 rev 3). As stated at the beginning of that document however, 'a balance must be struck between the desire to conserve the past and the need to renew for the future'.

### 1.2.2 Archaeology and Planning in the City of London

The Corporation of London's revised **Unitary Development Plan** (UDP) was adopted in April 2002. The policies set out in this document determine the position of archaeology as a material consideration in the planning process and incorporate recommendations from the Department of the Environment's **Planning Policy Guidance 16** (PPG 16).

The Corporation of London recognises that archaeology is a finite and fragile resource and that adequate safeguarding of ancient monuments and archaeological remains contribute to a better understanding of London's past. The Corporation's planning guide-lines are given focus in its strategy (Policy Strat 11A) for safeguarding ancient monuments and archaeological remains in the City:

---

5 p:\city\1000\109\na\field\unseval02.doc

**Method Statement © MoLAS**

---

**POLICY STRAT 11A:**  
To recognise the archaeological importance of the City as the historic centre of the capital and to seek the adequate safeguarding and investigation of ancient monuments and archaeological remains.

The Corporation’s *Unitary Development Plan* goes on to elaborate three Policies which deal specifically with archaeological preservation and investigations:

- **POLICY ARC1:**  
  To require planning applications which involve excavation or groundworks on sites of archaeological potential to be accompanied by an archaeological assessment and evaluation of the site including the impact of the proposed development.

- **POLICY ARC2:**  
  To require development proposals to preserve in situ, protect and safeguard important ancient monuments and important archaeological remains and their settings, and where appropriate, to require permanent public display and/or interpretation of the monument or remains.

- **POLICY ARC3:**  
  To ensure the proper investigation, recording of sites, and publication of the results, by an approved organisation as an integral part of a development programme where a development incorporates archaeological remains or where it is considered that preservation in situ is not appropriate.

The principle considerations which underpin these Policies are as follows:

- **Para 11.7:**  
  Strategic Guidance states that account should be taken of the desirability of preserving ancient monuments and their settings and of the Secretary of State’s guidance in PPG 16, Archaeology and Planning. Archaeological remains are an irreplaceable resource and often the only evidence of past development. These remains are a finite and non-renewable resource, in many cases highly fragile and vulnerable to damage and destruction. They contain irreplaceable information about our past and the potential for an increase in future knowledge.

- **Para 11.8:**  
  Where nationally important archaeological remains, whether scheduled or not,
