Attention Mr Clive Cornwell  

Dear Sir,  

**ST MARY SOMERSET TOWER, approvals ref. 05/0194 FULL and 0500195 LB**  

Further to our meeting on site, my letter of 3rd May 2009 and my conversation with Maureen Joyce today, please accept my re-iteration / clarification of my letter of 22nd July 2009:  

- With reference to the following drawings (submitted 22nd July 2009):  
  - SMS 201 elevations as approved (A1)  
  - SMS 203 sections [as approved and as proposed (A1)]  
  - SMS 211 level 1 plan as proposed (A2)  
  - SMS 212 level 2 plan as proposed (A2)  
  and structural engineering drawings (submitted 25th February 2009)  
  - SM080803-12A to SM080803-17A general arrangements levels 2 to 7 (A3)  
  - SM080803-021A general arrangements cladding (A3)  
  - SM080803-022A steelwork general arrangements (A3)  

1. These drawings illustrate proposed clarifications / amendments and are submitted for your approval in terms of satisfying detail conditions, mainly:  

   a) **[Condition 2 a]; Particulars and samples of the materials to be used on all external surfaces of the building +  
   Condition 2 f); details of new stonework facades to extensions]:** I confirm that the sample panel viewed is Portland Whitbed and that the shell distribution observed is typical, that is variable from virtually clear to well figured with shells and occasional shell voids. All as matching the stone from which the tower was originally constructed and as the previously approved sample (see approval 23rd August 2007 attached).  

   b) **[Condition 2 a]; Particulars and samples of the materials to be used on all external surfaces of the building +  
   Condition 2 c); details of new windows and external joinery +  
   Condition 2 e); details of junctions between original building and extension]:** the detail of the vertical strip windows between the extension and the tower is revised to a flush detailed window (black aluminium thin window sections with tinted glass and near flush detailing to maintain a visual separation between the new and existing stonework) as the previously submitted details would require a slot to be cut into the tower and we consider this to be a destructive detail. Further window section details / samples to be submitted.  

Continued /

**SMS: Clive Cornwell, City of London Department of Planning 31.07.2009**  
**Page 2**

c) **[Condition 2 f]; details of new stonework facades to extensions:**  
The wall construction is revised to a steel frame with blockwork infill and 75mm Portland stone (Whitbed) cladding, thermal insulation and an internal finish fair faced render.

d) **[Condition 2 e]; details of junctions between original building and extension:**  
The extension staircase is replaced by a passenger lift (electric platform type) with all of the associated plant and machinery within and attached to the extension; the face of the tower is unaltered as it acts as the exposed wall of the platform lift shaft and obviates the need for numerous fixings to the existing tower face (handrail etc).

2. Please note that the foregoing detail revisions will have no detrimental effect on the listed building and no significant effect on the external appearance of the extension (a slight change to the appearance of the strip windows).

3. I confirm the intention to otherwise proceed with construction of the works exactly as the approved drawings, specifications and samples.

Please note that, for the sake of clarity, I have repeated some of the assertions made in previous letters.

I would be obliged if you would confirm that the above listed information and amended information satisfies the relevant Conditions of approval.

Notwithstanding details / samples as mentioned above to be provided and approved, I would be obliged if you would confirm that Condition 2 of the approval has been satisfied in principle and that the "works thereby affected" can move forward to construction.

Yours faithfully,

(Signature)

**Brian Hendry**
