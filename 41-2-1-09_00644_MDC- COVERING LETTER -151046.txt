## ST MARY SOMERSET TOWER, Approvals Ref. 05/0194 FULL and 0500195 LB

Further to our meeting on site and my letter of 3rd May 2009:

1. **Please find enclosed 4 copies of drawings:**
   - SMS 201 elevations as approved (A1)
   - SMS 203 sections [as approved and as proposed (A1)]
   - SMS 211 level 1 plan as proposed (A2)
   - SMS 212 level 2 plan as proposed (A2)

2. **These drawings illustrate the proposed changes to the approved plans, mainly:**
   - The detail of the vertical windows between the extension and the tower is revised to a flush detailed window (black aluminium thin window sections with tinted glass and near flush detailing to maintain a visual separation between the new and existing stonework) as the current (approved) detail requires a slot to be cut into the tower and we consider this to be a destructive detail.
   - The wall construction is revised to a steel frame with blockwork infill and 75mm Portland stone (Whitbed) cladding, thermal insulation, and an internal finish fair faced render.
   - The extension staircase is replaced by a passenger extension.

3. **The foregoing detail revisions will have no effect on the listed building and no significant effect on the external appearance of the extension** (a slight change to the appearance of the strip windows).

4. **I confirm that the sample panel viewed is Portland Whitbed and that the shell distribution observed is typical**, that is variable from virtually clear to well figured with shells and occasional shell voids. All as matching the stone from which the tower was originally constructed and as the previously approved sample (see approval 23rd August 2007 attached).

5. **I confirm the intention to otherwise proceed with construction of the works exactly as the approved drawings, specifications, and samples.**

*Page 2*

Please note that, for the sake of clarity, I have repeated some of the assertions made in my letter of 3rd May 2009.

I believe that, along with the structural details previously submitted by the structural engineer, this information finalises the information required and I would be obliged if you would confirm your approval of the revised drawings and that you have no further requirements that would impede us moving ahead with construction.

Yours faithfully,
