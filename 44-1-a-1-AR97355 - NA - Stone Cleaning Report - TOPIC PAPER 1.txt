1. Consideration has been given to whether the stonework needs to be cleaned. There is no structural or architectural reason to clean the building - the accumulation of soot is not, for instance, affecting the structure's ability to shed water, nor is it threatening the integrity of carved details. The decision is purely aesthetic.

2. We would like to conclude, subject to approval, that the only area where accumulated soot and other particulates are unattractive is in the lower stage of the tower. Once it is possible to closely inspect this area with Officers, it might be appropriate to propose spot cleaning this area.

3. The objective would be to achieve a suitable visual 'blend' with adjacent areas of stonework, which would not be cleaned. The design team proposes developing a method statement with a specialist contractor in the coming months, and then agreeing this with English Heritage and the City of London.

4. As for the stonework, the potential for repairs needs also to be discussed with English Heritage and the City of London on site during the early stages of the project commencing.

5. At present, the Tower and its carved stonework have what might be described as a patina of respectable decay. This wear and minor damage do not pose a material threat to the structure of the building and its fabric. However, it is a Building at Risk, and it might be that further detailed investigation identifies damage that will need repair. We will, of course, ensure English Heritage and The City is fully informed and submit detailed repair proposals prior to undertaking any work.

6. It is noted that slight damage to the cornices has, however, reduced their ability to shed rainwater effectively, with consequent streaking. The design team proposes to provide lead flashings to the cornices, again developing suitable details in discussion with English Heritage and the City of London during detailed design development.
