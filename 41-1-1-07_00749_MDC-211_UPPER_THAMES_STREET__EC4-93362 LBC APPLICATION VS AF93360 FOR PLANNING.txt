**Dear Ms Daly**

## Tower of St Mary Somerset  
211 Upper Thames Street, EC4  
Submission of Details to Discharge Conditions and For Information  
LPA Refs: 05/00194/FULL and 05/00195/LBC

Further to our meeting at your Office on 12th July and in anticipation of the meeting with you on 19th July, we have pleasure in enclosing the following:

- **Application to discharge condition 2 (a) to (h)** attached to Listed Building Consent (05/00195/LBC);
- **Application to discharge condition 2 (a) to (g)** attached to Planning Permission (05/00194/FULL); and
- **Application to discharge archaeological conditions 9 and 10** attached to planning permission (05/00194/FULL).

As you will note, we have tried to make the submission of these details as simple as possible, bearing in mind that it is now more than two years since the grant of principal planning permission and listed building consent.

Therefore, we have decided to submit in one document **[BIBLE I]** all the documents that have been approved and all the documents that you will need to discharge of condition 2 (a) to (h).

There is a separate bundle of documents to discharge condition 10 regarding the archaeological watching brief.

We have also attached to this letter a schedule summarising all the conditions and their current status.

We trust the enclosed documentation is in order? However, should you have any queries whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact me.

**Yours sincerely**

*Richard Greenwood*
